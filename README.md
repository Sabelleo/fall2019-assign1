CPSC 350-02 Data Structures

Assignment 1: No Data Structures

Sabelle O'Connell

To run code, go to directory containing code in a location that runs g++

type 

g++ *.cpp -o foobar.out

and then

./foobar.out fileNameHere.txt

if you enter no file or an invalid file, enter a file in the directory that works instead.
